Analyze sales data to identify top-performing products and trends.
## Key Insights & Recommendations:
+ Dominant Acquisition Channel:
  + Insight: Google-Ads consistently generated the highest volume of orders, demonstrating its effectiveness as the primary customer acquisition channel.
  + Recommendation: Recommend increasing investment and optimizing campaign strategies within Google-Ads to capitalize on its proven ability to drive conversions.
+ Highest Profitability Driver:
  + Insight: The 'Plants' category emerged as the most profitable product segment.
  + Recommendation: Advise the marketing team to strategically highlight and aggressively promote 'Plants' in future campaigns, potentially through dedicated campaigns or premium product placements, to maximize overall revenue.
+ High-Volume Complementary Products:
  + Insight: While 'Plants' lead in profitability, 'Plant Care' and 'Seeds' accounted for the highest quantities sold, suggesting their popularity as accessible entry points or essential complementary purchases.
  + Recommendation: Suggest leveraging these high-volume categories for cross-selling and bundling opportunities with 'Plants' (e.g., "Buy a plant, get discounted plant care"), and using them as attractors for new customers due to their lower barrier to entry.
+ Geographic Concentration:
  + Insight: The majority of orders originated from the United States, highlighting a concentrated and strong customer base within this region.
  + Recommendation: Recommend deepening market penetration strategies within the US market, potentially by segmenting campaigns further by state or region, while carefully evaluating the cost-effectiveness and market potential of expanding into other geographical areas.
